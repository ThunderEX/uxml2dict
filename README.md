uxml2dict
=========
This is a python module which implement part of [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict) on [micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython).

It's based on [xmltok](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/tree/master/xmltok) module in micropython-lib. And thus, it receive a file IO type instead of string used in [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict).
